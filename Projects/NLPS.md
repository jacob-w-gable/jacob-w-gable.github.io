## NLPS (Natural Language Processing Script)
This is my favorite long-term project. I am trying to create a language called NLPS. NLPS would give a programmer the ability to very easily create an AI or an AI assistant in the form of a chatbot. To program in this language, one must simply write out a verbal exchange between a human and a computer. The advantage to using NLPS is that the conversations will be able to sound natural without the user having to speak in perfect words. Verbal exchanges initiated by a computer can be triggered by events such as the time of day. Verbal exchanges can also trigger programs or scripts to be executed. This project has gone through several design iterations, and I even made a few prototypes. However, I currently have no code because I want to design the entire language before beginning on the coding.
